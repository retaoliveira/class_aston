## What is a model?

<hr></hr>
.large[
a usually miniature representation of something

a system of postulates, data, and inferences presented as a mathematical description of an entity or state of affairs

an example for imitation or emulation

a person or thing that serves as a pattern for an artist

## What is a model?

.large[
~~a usually miniature representation of something~~

**a system of postulates, data, and inferences presented as a mathematical description of an entity or state of affairs**

~~an example for imitation or emulation~~

~~a person or thing that serves as a pattern for an artist~~

## Why do we model transportation phenomena?

.midi[
.question[
Modelling is an important part of most decision-making processes with no real-world interference.
]

.question[
Get the best understanding that we can of the current situation and how this may, with or without our interference, evolve in the future. 
]

.question[
Representation and analysis of the interactions among **supply**, **demand** and **activity systems**. Can be descriptive, but more often there is the explicit aim of seeking the key links between causes and effects in transport decision-making either by the providers of transport services or by the users.
]

.question[
**Design** and **ex-ante evaluation** of transport systems cannot be measured
]
]

## Why do we model transportation phenomena?

## Is it easy to model transportation?

<hr></hr>

.large[
.pull-left[

- capacity constraints
- variation across the time dimension
- dynamic and pseudo-dynamic assignment - queing

]


.pull-right[
- availability of data
- complexity
- behavioural - derived demand
- trip chaining
- multiple consumer classes
]
]

## Where is transportation modelling heading?
<hr></hr>

.large[
- Balances complexity and decision support/communication ability.  
- Is as disaggregated as possible, limited to data and communicability.   
- Isolates key relationships, not to replicate the entire structure.   
- Contains many of the key features of the complete structure, but is simplified to aid analysis.   
- Focus on the key relationships and explores the available data   
- Is concerned with causal effects.   
- Focus on policy-making for different societal groups   
]

---

## Where is transportation modelling heading?
<hr></hr>

.large[
- Is not based on “political modelling", but takes into account diversity    
- Is flexible between forecasting and backcasting approaches.   
- Its framework concerns "transport is a derived demand".    
- Aims at managing the city and not only accommodating demand. Make the best use of existing capacity.   
- Takes into account social, environmental and economic pressures and changes in space and time.   
- Concerns effective assessments, usually within a broad cost–benefit framework   
- Is reproducible, crowdsourced and understandable by different actors.
